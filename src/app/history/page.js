                            <p>Dedicated service to mankind has been the sole nutrient of the Sikh faith rather than any useless rites or rituals. This way of thinking rooted in contributive manual labor or votive offering for the underprivileged was illustrated by personal style and sacrifice of the Sikh Gurus and carried forward by their ardent followers to have an impact on humanity.</p>
                            <p>The establishment of Chief Khalsa Diwan on 30 October 1902 bears testimony to the dreams of some committed stalwarts of the Guru Khalsa Panth. Opening session of the new organization designated as Chief Khalsa Diwan was held in the Malwai Bunga, Sri Darbar Sahib Amritsar on 30 October 1902. The inaugural Ardaas was performed by S. Teja Singh of Bhasur. Bhai Arjan Singh Bagrian was elected as President, S. Sunder Singh Majithia Secretary and S. Sujan Singh Sodhi Addl. Secretary. In addition to these office bearers, 18 other members were inducted in the executive committee. On 9 July 1904 Chief Khalsa Diwan was registered under Act XXI, 1860. Presently, the main office of the Chief Khalsa Diwan is located on G. T. Road about one Km from Amritsar Railway Station. It also houses the beautiful air-conditioned Gurdwara for recitation of Gurbani and holding religious congregations. Chief Khalsa Diwan is serving society since 1902. It is a premier educational and socio-religious institution which is held in high esteem all over the world for its humanitarian and dedicated service.</p>
